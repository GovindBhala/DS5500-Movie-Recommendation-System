    "# Combine collaborative filtering and content recommendation results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produce half recommendations from collaborative filtering and half from the content model (half based on specified number of recommendations top_n)\n",
    "- Content model recommendations out of movies not included in collaborative filtering recommendations _for that user_ \n",
    "- Re-sort based on similarity scores \n",
    "    - Need to redo this to sort on weighted average of movie ratings such that we produce the most \"credible\"/recognizable results first to gain the user's trust before presenting long tail recommendations\n",
    "    - And here the similarity scores are entirely different. From collab filtering, it is predicted rating (0.5-5) and from content it is cosine similarity \n",

    "- user_id: ID of user to generate recommendations for\n",
    "- df1: sparse matrix of movie attributes in one hot encoded fashion with attributes from for content model \n",
    "- ratings: ratings data for each user (movies rated + star ratings)\n",
    "- movieIds: list of all movie Ids (rows of sparse matrix)\n",
    "- keep_movies1: [] -- dummy parameter so that this funciton as the same inputs as the other recommendation models\n",
    "- collab_predictions: pregenerated collaborative filtering predictions. Equivalent of df2 in other recommendation model parameters\n",
    "- keep_movies2: [] -- dummy parameter so that this funciton as the same inputs as the other recommendation models\n",
    "- content_recommendation_system: recommendation system to use to generate recs for content model\n",
    "    - Module of a function in another script\n",
