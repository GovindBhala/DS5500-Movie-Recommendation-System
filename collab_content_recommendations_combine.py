# # Combine collaborative filtering and content recommendation results
# 
# - Produce half recommendations from collaborative filtering and half from the content model (half based on specified number of recommendations top_n)
# - Content model recommendations out of movies not included in collaborative filtering recommendations _for that user_ 
# - Re-sort based on similarity scores 
#     - Need to redo this to sort on weighted average of movie ratings such that we produce the most "credible"/recognizable results first to gain the user's trust before presenting long tail recommendations
#     - And here the similarity scores are entirely different. From collab filtering, it is predicted rating (0.5-5) and from content it is cosine similarity 
# 
# Parameters:
# - user_id: ID of user to generate recommendations for
# - df1: sparse matrix of movie attributes in one hot encoded fashion with attributes from for content model 
# - ratings: ratings data for each user (movies rated + star ratings)
# - movieIds: list of all movie Ids (rows of sparse matrix)
# - keep_movies1: [] -- dummy parameter so that this funciton as the same inputs as the other recommendation models
# - collab_predictions: pregenerated collaborative filtering predictions. Equivalent of df2 in other recommendation model parameters
# - keep_movies2: [] -- dummy parameter so that this funciton as the same inputs as the other recommendation models
# - content_recommendation_system: recommendation system to use to generate recs for content model
#     - Module of a function in another script
# - top_n: number of recommendations total to produce
