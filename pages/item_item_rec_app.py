# # Item-Item Recommendations for Non-Users (Similar Movies)
# **Use Case**: User without a profile can get recommendations based on a movie they have previously enjoyed by displaying similar movies.    
# Details:
# - Allow users to put in a movie that they liked and output similar movies     
# - For a first pass, use a simple tf-idf genre-based recommendation model. Will update with movie profiles from personalized recommendations     
# - If same similarity score (aka same genres), recommend highest rated based on weighted average 
#     - Generally want diverse recommendations, expose long tail HOWEVER these people are already non-users who are not rating movies, thus want to give credibility to draw them in and get them to watch anything 
#     - Nothing to based the diverse recommendations on other than randomness. 
#

# # Streamlit App with User Input
# - User input: text input
# - Find options that are close to the text input based on fuzzy string matching
#     - Works for not-quite-right movie title and misspellings
#     - Top 10 IF similarity ratio > 70. Don't display anything if similarity too low
# - Select out of drop down. Drop down includes (year) 
#     - Some titles are duplicate so need year
# - Get movieId from selection and use that as recommendation input
